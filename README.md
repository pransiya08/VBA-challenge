module 2 challenge

#Introduction
This project includes a VBA script that analyses an Excel spreadsheet of stock market data.
It would summarise the whole sheet and show the relevant informations to be used in analysis.

#Instructions
Create a VBA script that would analyse any given Excel spreadsheet of stock market data.
It should summarise the data and should have the following outputs:
    *ticker symbol
    *yearly change denoting the difference between closing value of the year and the opening value of the year
    *percentage change of the difference of the closing and opening values of the year
    *the total stock volume of the ticker for the whole year

As a bonus, the VBA should also out the following analyses:
    *ticker with the highest %increase
    *ticker with the highest %decrease
    *ticker with the highest stock volume

The script will summarise all the tabs/worksheets in the spreadsheet and provide the same information as above for each of the sheets
